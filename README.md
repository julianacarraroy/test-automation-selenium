# Test automation with Selenium Webdriver

This project was developed to perform automated tests on the website [The-Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) 
as part of the 'Selenium WebDriver with JAVA' course offered by [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/learningpaths.html).

## About the project

- This project underlines the basics of using Selenium WebDriver to write end-to-end automated tests

-  The project uses [*Page Objects*](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/) to capture the relevant behaviors of a web page and build the tests.

## What I learned

- Techniques to find elements such as _buttons, links, text, dropdowns, and more_ within a web application


- WebDriver API calls to interact with those elements such as clicking, entering and reading text, selecting options, handling popups and alerts, uploading files, working with iframes, and more


- Advanced interactions, such as hovering and sending alternative keys like tab, as well as symbols


- How to integrate the WebDriver API with a test assertion library, such as TestNG


- How to organize our test code using the **Page Object Model**


- Various wait strategies to control the timing of our scripts and avoid flaky tests


- How to take screenshots during test executions


- How to have our code listen for specific WebDriver events and perform additional actions, like logging our test activity


- How to customize the browser used in test execution


- How to run headless tests


- How to navigate multiple open tabs within a browser, as well as cookie management


- And how to write custom actions using JavaScript
